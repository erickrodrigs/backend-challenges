# Backend challenges

This repository contains some implementations of the backend challenges in [this repo](https://github.com/CollabCodeTech/backend-challenges).

The purpose of this repo is to practice my software development skills. I'm willing to practice clean code and design patterns, some architectures such as Hexagonal and Clean Architecture, Domain Driven Design, architecture documentation, and different programming languages and frameworks in order to improve my knowledge about Software Engineering in general.
